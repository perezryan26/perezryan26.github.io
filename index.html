<h1>Project 1 Report: The Elevator Interface</h1>
<h2>Ryan Perez</h2>
<p>I chose the elevator at The Carlton House for my presentation. When I initially interacted with the elevator’s control interface, I couldn’t find any issues. I thought the design looked clean and it was very easy to distinguish the functionality of every button.  </p>
<p>The elevator’s control interface is very strong in its design. The floor buttons are arranged in a vertical orientation, which makes for a clear and simplified interface. The other buttons are grouped together underneath the floor buttons and have symbols that clearly identify their functionality. </p>
<p>The only reason that I use an elevator is to get on a different floor than I’m already on. If I’m in New York city and need to get to the 50th floor, I much rather take the elevator than walk up 50 flights of stairs. </p>
<p>A user typically interacts with an elevator by initially pressing a button to call the elevator. Once they enter the elevator, they will press the number for the floor they wish to get to.</p>
<p>The elevator provides feedback to the user via lights and sounds. When you press a button, the light turns off and turns back on and makes a beep sound when its action is completed.</p>
<p>I don’t think that there are any common mistakes with the elevator control interface that I chose. The straightforward design makes it very difficult to incorrectly use the interface.</p>
<p>An improvement that I would make on the control interface would be to swap the open and close door buttons with the alarm and call button because they are used more often.</p>

<p>When a floor button(1-5) is pressed, the corresponding buttons light will turn off and it will turn back on and beep when the floor is reached.
    The four bottom buttons light's never turn off and each make a beep immediately after they are pressed. There is also a floor tracker at the top of the interface so that the user always knows what floor they are on.
