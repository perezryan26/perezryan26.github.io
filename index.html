<h1>Project 1 Report: The Elevator Interface</h1>
<p>I chose the elevator at The Carlton House for my presentation. The elevator's control interface was nice to the eyes and had a straighforward design. The only modification I would make on the elevator's control interface would be to swap the alarm and phone buttons with the open and close door buttons. I modeled my touch screen elevator control interface after the carlton's elevator control interface because I really liked their design and I wanted my control interface to simulate interacting with a elevator that has buttons.</p>
